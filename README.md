# HiOp - HPC solver for optimization
![tests](https://github.com/LLNL/hiop/workflows/tests/badge.svg)

HiOp is an optimization solver for solving certain mathematical optimization problems expressed as nonlinear programming problems. HiOp is a lightweight HPC solver that leverages application's existing data parallelism to parallelize the optimization iterations by using specialized linear algebra kernels.

## Build/install instructions
HiOp uses a CMake-based build system. A standard build can be done by invoking in the 'build' directory the following 
```shell 
$> cmake ..
$> make 
$> make test
$> make install
```
This sequence will build HiOp, run integrity and correctness tests, and install the headers and the library in the directory '_dist-default-build' in HiOp's root directory. 

Command `make test` runs extensive tests of the various modules of HiOp to check integrity and correctness. The tests suite range from unit testing to solving concrete optimization problems and checking the performance of HiOp solvers on these problems against known solutions. By default `make test` runs `mpirun` locally, which may not work on some HPC machines. For these HiOp allows using `bsub` to schedule `make test` on the compute nodes; to enable this, the use should use *-DHIOP_TEST_WITH_BSUB=ON* with cmake when building and run `make test` in a bsub shell session, for example,
```
bsub -P your_proj_name -nnodes 1 -W 30
make test
CTRL+D
```

The installation can be customized using the standard CMake options. For example, one can provide an alternative installation directory for HiOp by using 
```sh
$> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib/hiop ..'
```


### Selected HiOp-specific build options
* Enable/disable MPI: *-DHIOP_USE_MPI=[ON/OFF]* (by default ON)
* GPU support: *-DHIOP_USE_GPU=ON*. MPI can be either off or on. For more build system options related to GPUs, see "Dependencies" section below.
* Use RAJA portability layer to allow running linear algebra in either host (CPU) or device (GPU): *-DHIOP_USE_RAJA=ON* and *-DHIOP_USE_UMPIRE=ON*. These build options are off by default. Currently, HiOp only supports unified memory space.
* Enable/disable "developer mode" build that enforces more restrictive compiler rules and guidelines: *-DHIOP_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON*. This option is by default off.
* Additional checks and self-diagnostics inside HiOp meant to detect anormalities and help to detect bugs and/or troubleshoot problematic instances: *-DHIOP_DEEPCHECKS=[ON/OFF]* (by default ON). Disabling HIOP_DEEPCHECKS usually provides 30-40% execution speedup in HiOp. For full strength, it is recomended to use HIOP_DEEPCHECKS with debug builds. With non-debug builds, in particular the ones that disable the assert macro, HIOP_DEEPCHECKS does not perform all checks and, thus, may overlook potential issues.

For example:
```shell 
$> cmake -DHIOP_USE_MPI=ON -DHIOP_DEEPCHECKS=ON ..
$> make 
$> make test
$> make install
```


### Other useful options to use with CMake
* *-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release* will build the code with the optimization flags on
* *-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3"* will enable a high level of compiler code optimization

### Dependencies
HiOp requires LAPACK and BLAS. These dependencies are automatically detected by the build system. MPI is optional and by default enabled. To disable use cmake option '-DHIOP_USE_MPI=OFF'.

HiOp has some support for NVIDIA **GPU-based computations** via CUDA and Magma. To enable the use of GPUs,  use cmake with '-DHIOP_USE_GPU=ON'. The build system will automatically search for CUDA Toolkit. For non-standard CUDA Toolkit installations, use '-DHIOP_CUDA_LIB_DIR=/path' and '-DHIOP_CUDA_INCLUDE_DIR=/path'. For "very" non-standard CUDA Toolkit installations, one can specify the directory of cuBlas libraries as well with '-DHIOP_CUBLAS_LIB_DIR=/path'.

When RAJA-based portability abstraction layer is enabled, HiOp requires RAJA and UMPIRE libraries 

### Support for GPU computations

When GPU support is on, HiOp requires Magma and CUDA Toolkit. Both are detected automatically in most normal use. The typical cmake command to enable GPU support in HiOp is
```shell 
$> cmake -DHIOP_USE_GPU=ON ..
```

When Magma is not detected, one can specify its location by passing `-DHIOP_MAGMA_DIR=/path/to/magma/dir` to cmake.

For custom CUDA Toolkit installations, the locations to the (missing/not found) CUDA libraries can be specified to cmake via `-DNAME=/path/cuda/directory/lib`, where `NAME` can be any of  
```
CUDA_cublas_LIBRARY
CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY
CUDA_cudadevrt_LIBRARY
CUDA_cusparse_LIBRARY
CUDA_cublasLt_LIBRARY
CUDA_nvblas_LIBRARY
CUDA_culibos_LIBRARY
 ```
Below is an example for specifiying `cuBlas`, `cuBlasLt`, and `nvblas` libraries, which were `NOT_FOUND` because of a non-standard CUDA Toolkit instalation:
```shell 
$> cmake -DHIOP_USE_GPU=ON -DCUDA_cublas_LIBRARY=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/lib64 -DCUDA_cublasLt_LIBRARY=/export/home/petra1/work/installs/cuda10.2.89/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/ -DCUDA_nvblas_LIBRARY=/export/home/petra1/work/installs/cuda10.2.89/targets/x86_64-linux/lib/ .. && make -j && make install
```

A detailed example on how to compile HiOp straight of the box on `summit.olcf.ornl.gov` is available [here](README_summit.md).

RAJA and UMPIRE dependencies are usually detected by HiOp's cmake build system. 

### Kron reduction

Kron reduction functionality of HiOp is disabled by default. One can enable it by using 
```shell
$> rm -rf *; cmake -DHIOP_WITH_KRON_REDUCTION=ON -DUMFPACK_DIR=/Users/petra1/work/installs/SuiteSparse-5.7.1 -DMETIS_DIR=/Users/petra1/work/installs/metis-4.0.3 .. && make -j && make install
```
Metis is usually detected automatically and needs not be specified under normal circumstances.

UMFPACK (part of SuiteSparse) and METIS need to be provided as shown above.

# Interfacing with HiOp 

HiOp supports three types of optimization problems, each with a separate input formats in the form of the C++ interfaces `hiopInterfaceDenseConstraints`,`hiopInterfaceSparse` and `hiopInterfaceMDS`. These interfaces are specified in [hiopInterface.hpp](src/Interface/hiopInterface.hpp) and documented and discussed as well in the [user manual](doc/hiop_usermanual.pdf).

*`hiopInterfaceDenseConstraints` interface* supports NLPs with **billions** of variables with and without bounds but only limited number (<100) of general, equality and inequality constraints. The underlying algorithm is a limited-memory quasi-Newton interior-point method and generally scales well computationally (but it may not algorithmically) on thousands of cores. This interface uses MPI for parallelization

*`hiopInterfaceSparse` interface* supports general sparse and large-scale NLPs. This functionality is similar to that of the state-of-the-art [Ipopt](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt) (without being as robust and flexible as Ipopt is). Acceleration for this class of problems can be achieved via OpenMP or CUDA, however, this is work in progress and you are encouraged to contact HiOp's developers for up-to-date information.

*`hiopInterfaceMDS` interface* supports mixed dense-sparse NLPs and achives parallelization using GPUs and RAJA portability abstraction layer. 

More information on the HiOp interfaces are [here](src/Interface/README.md).

## Running HiOp tests and applications

HiOp is using NVBlas library when built with CUDA support. If you don't specify
location of the `nvblas.conf` configuration file, you may get an annoying
warnings. HiOp provides default `nvblas.conf` file and installs it at the same
location as HiOp libraries. To use it, set environment variable as
```bash
$ export NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE=<hiop install dir>/lib/nvblas.conf
```
or, if you are using C-shell, as
```shell
$ setenv NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE <hiop install dir>/lib/nvblas.conf
```
