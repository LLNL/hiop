/**
 * Base class (interface) for specifying optimization NLPs that have separable terms in the 
 * objective, which we coin as "primal decomposable" problems. 
 * 
 * The following structure and terminology is assumed
 *
 *   min  basecase + sum { r_i(x) : i=1,...,S}      (primal decomposable NLP)
 *    x
 *
 * where 'basecase' refers to an NLP of a general form in the optimization variable 'x'. 
 * Furthermore, borrowing from stochastic programming terminology, the terms 'r_i' are called 
 * recourse terms, or, in short, r-term.
 * 
 * In order to solve the above problem, HiOp solver will perform a series of approximations and will
 * require the user to solve a so-called 'master' problem
 * 
 *   min  basecase +  q(x)                            (master NLP)
 *    x
 * where q(x) are convex differentiable approximations of r_i(x). 
 * 
 * The user is required to maintain and solve the master problem, more specifically
 *  - to add quadratic regularization to the basecase NLP to obtain the master NLP as
 * instructed by HiOp via @set_quadratic_regularization
 *  - (re)solve master NLP and return the primal optimal solution 'x' to HiOp via
 * @solve function.
 *
 * In addition, the user is required to implement 
 *     @eval_f_rterm 
 *     @eval_grad_rterm
 * to allow HiOp to compute function value and gradient vector individually for each recourse 
 * term  r_i. This will be done at arbitrary vectors 'x' that will be decided by HiOp.
