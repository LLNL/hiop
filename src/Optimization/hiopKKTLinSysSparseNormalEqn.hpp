/** 
 * @brief Provides the functionality for reducing the KKT linear system to the
 * normal equation system below in dyc and dyd variables and then to perform
 * the basic ops needed to compute the remaining directions
 *
 * Relies on the pure virtual 'solveCompressed' to form and solve the compressed
 * linear system
 * ( [ Jc  0 ] [ H+Dx+delta_wx     0       ]^{-1} [ Jc^T  Jd^T ] + [ -delta_cc     0     ] ) [dyc] = [ ryc_tilde ]
 * ( [ Jd -I ] [   0           Dd+delta_wd ]      [  0     -I  ]   [    0      -delta_cd ] ) [dyd]   [ ryd_tilde ]
 *
 * [ ryc_tilde ] = [ Jc  0 ] [ H+Dx+delta_wx     0       ]^{-1}  [ rx_tilde ] - [ ryc ] 
 * [ ryd_tilde ]   [ Jd -I ] [   0           Dd+delta_wd ]       [ rd_tilde ]   [ ryd ]
 * 
 * where
 *  - Jc and Jd present the sparse Jacobians for equalities and inequalities
 *  - H is a sparse Hessian matrix
 *  - Dx is diagonal corresponding to x variable in the log-barrier diagonal Dx, respectively
 *
 * REMARK: This linear system fits LP/QP best, where H is empty and hence only diagonal matrices are inversed.
 * If H is diagonal, the normal equation matrix becomes:
 *   [ Jc(H+Dx+delta_wx)^{-1}Jc^T    Jc(H+Dx+delta_wx)^{-1}Jd^T ]                        + [ -delta_cc     0     ] 
 *   [ Jd(H+Dx+delta_wx)^{-1}Jc^T    Jd(H+Dx+delta_wx)^{-1}Jd^T + ( Dd+delta_wd)^{-1} ]    [    0      -delta_cd ]
