/* 
 * Solves KKTLinSysCompressedXYcYd by exploiting the mixed dense-sparse (MDS)
 * structure of the problem
 *
 * In general, the so-called XYcYd system has the form
 * [  H  +  Dx     Jc^T  Jd^T   ] [ dx]   [ rx_tilde ]
 * [    Jc          0     0     ] [dyc] = [   ryc    ]
 * [    Jd          0   -Dd^{-1}] [dyd]   [ ryd_tilde]
 *
 * For MDS structure, the above linear system is exactly
 * [  Hs  +  Dxs    0       Jcs^T   Jds^T   ] [dxs]   [ rxs_tilde ]
 * [     0        Hd+Dxd    Jcd^T   Jdd^T   ] [dxd]   [ rxd_tilde ]
 * [    Jcs        Jcd        0       0     ] [dyc] = [   ryc    ]
 * [    Jds        Jdd        0    -Dd^{-1} ] [dyd]   [ ryd_tilde]
 * where 
 *  - Jcs and Jds contain the sparse columns of the Jacobians Jc and Jd
 *  - Jcd and Jdd contain the dense  columns of the Jacobians Jc and Jd
 *  - Hs is a diagonal matrix (sparse part of the Hessian)
 *  - Hd is the dense part of the Hessian
 *  - Dxs and Dxd are diagonals corresponding to sparse (xs) and dense (xd) 
 * variables in the log-barrier diagonal Dx, respectively
 *
 * 'solveCompressed' performs a reduction to
 * [ Hd+Dxd               Jcd^T                          Jdd^T              ] [dxd]   
 * [  Jcd       -Jcs(Hs+Dxs)^{-1}Jcs^T                   K_21               ] [dyc] = 
 * [  Jdd                 K_21^T             -Jds(Hs+Dxs)^{-1}Jds^T-Dd^{-1} ] [dyd]   
 *     
 *                                              [ rxd_tilde                             ]
 *                                          =   [ ryc       - Jcs(Hs+Dxs)^{-1}rxs_tilde ]
 *                                              [ ryd_tilde - Jds(Hs+Dxs)^{-1}rxs_tilde ]
 * where
 * K_21 = - Jcs * (Hs+Dxs)^{-1} * Jds^T
 *
 * Then get dxs from
 * dxs = (Hs+Dxs)^{-1}[rxs_tilde - Jcs^T dyc - Jds^T dyd]
