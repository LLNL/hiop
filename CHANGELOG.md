All notable changes to HiOp are documented in this file.

## Version 0.6.2:  Initial ginkgo solver integration and misc fixes
This tag provides an initial integration with ginko, fixes a couple of issues, and add options for (outer) iterative refinement.

## Version 0.6.1: HIP linear algebra workaround and update for RAJA > v0.14  (March 31, 2022)
This version/tag provides a workaround for an issue in the HIP BLAS and updates the RAJA code to better operate with the newer versions of RAJA.

## Version 0.6.0: Release of the PriDec optimization and improved GPU computations (March 31, 2022)
The salient features of v0.6.0 are 

- the release of the primal decomposition (PriDec) solver for structured two-stage problems

Other notable capabilities include
 - improved accuracy in the computations of the search directions via Krylov-based iterative refinement
 - design of a matrix interface for sparse matrices in compressed sparse row format and (capable) CPU reference implementation

## Version 0.5.4: Elastic mode, Krylov solvers, and misc bug fixes (March 2, 2022)
New algorithmic features related to the NLP solver(s) and associated linear algebra KKT systems

 - soft feasibility restoration
 - Relaxer of equality constraints at the NLP formulation level
 - Krylov interfaces and implementation for CG and BiCGStab (ready for device computations)
 - protype of the condensed linear system and initial Krylov-based iterative refinement
 - update of the Magma solver class for the latest Magma API
 - elastic mode
 
This release also includes several bug fixes.
