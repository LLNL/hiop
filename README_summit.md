## Option 1: using on libraries generally available on Summit

Building and running HiOp on `summit` is quite simple since the dependencies of HiOp can be satisfied quickly using the `module` utility. Please note that supports only a limited number of external dependecies and, as a result, HiOp cannot be usually built with all the features (for example dependences for sparse linear algebra will not be satisfied).
```
module load gcc/8.1.1 cmake/3.17.3 netlib-lapack/3.8.0 cuda/10.1.105 magma/2.5.1
```
Different versions of the above modules may conflict with each other; in this case, one needs to inquire additional compatibility information using `module spider package_name`.

Next HiOp with GPU support can be `cmake`'d, built, and tested using
```
cd build/
CC=/sw/summit/gcc/8.1.1/bin/gcc CXX=/sw/summit/gcc/8.1.1/bin/g++ cmake -DHIOP_USE_GPU=ON ..
make -j
make test
make install
```
In some cases, `cmake` picks up a different gcc compiler than the one loaded via `module`. This situation can be remedied by preloading the `CC` and `CXX` for `cmake` as it is done above.

Depending on the LAPACK/BLAS CPU library loaded by the `module` command, runtime crashes can occur (intermintently for different problems/linear systems sizes) if the `nvblas.conf` cannot be find or is not specifying the so-called NVBLAS CPU BLAS library required by CUDA. This can be remedied by specifying the location of the BLAS library in `NVBLAS_CPU_BLAS_LIB` in the `nvblas.conf` file; for example, this can be done by
```
NVBLAS_CPU_BLAS_LIB /autofs/nccs-svm1_sw/summit/.swci/1-compute/opt/spack/20180914/linux-rhel7-ppc64le/gcc-8.1.1/netlib-lapack-3.8.0-p74bsneivus4jck562lq7drw2s7i4ytd/lib64/libblas.so
```
For non-standard locations of `nvblas.conf`, one can specify the path to `nvblas.conf` via the environment variable `NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE`; for example, this can be achieved by exporting the variable in your submission `your_job_file.lsf` file:
```
# ##LSF directives  here
#  other commands here
# example assumes a bash shell
export NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE=/ccs/home/cpetra/work/projects/hiop/runs/nvblas.conf 

# jsrun command here

```

## Option 2 - using precompiled dependencies made available by exaSGD project


## Option 3 - using Spack

### Using official Spack recipe
[[to be done]]

This will not support some important dependencies of the sparse solver of HiOp. 

### Custom Spack-based build to build HiOp's sparse

####Method 1:####
Install hiop and all its dependencies from scratch via spack:
1.	Download ExaSGD_Spack repository 
```bash
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.pnnl.gov:2222/exasgd/ExaSGD_Spack.git 
```
2.	 Switch to branch summit-install 
```bash
cd ExaSGD_spack
git checkout summit-install
```
3.	Install spack
```bash
./install.sh summit
```
4.	Source spack environment file. This should allow you to run spack commands.
```bash
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```
5.	Load the precompiled modules used by the spack exago script, which is in folder hiop/scripts under HiOp's root directory. 
```
#make sure you are in hiop/scripts under HiOp's root directory
source build_summit.sh
```
6.	Create spack environment, using `environments/summit/hiop-develop-sparse.yaml`. The yaml file has configuration for installing hiop and all its dependencies. 
            (To build ExaGO, please use other yaml files in the folder environments/summit)
```bash
spack env create hiop-sparse-coinhsl-llnl environments/summit/hiop-develop-sparse.yaml
```
7.	Activate the environment
```bash
spack env activate hiop-sparse-coinhsl-llnl
```
8.	Download coinhsl-2015.06.23.tar.gz from hsl, and rename it as coinhsl-archive-2015.06.23.tar.gz. Place this file in the current folder (ExaSGD_spack) 
9.	Install the packages
```bash
spack install
```

####Method 2:####
Install *ONLY* coinhsl via spack:
1.	Download ExaSGD_Spack repository 
```bash
git clone ssh://git@gitlab.pnnl.gov:2222/exasgd/ExaSGD_Spack.git 
```
2.	 Switch to branch summit-install 
```bash
cd ExaSGD_spack
git checkout summit-install
```
3.	Install spack
```bash
./install.sh summit
```
4.	Source spack environment file. This should allow you to run spack commands.
```bash
source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```
5.	Load some precompiled modules used by the project ExaGO. It is saved in folder hiop/scripts. (in branch summit-env-dev)
```bash
source build_summit.sh 
```
6.	Download coinhsl-2015.06.23.tar.gz from hsl, and rename it as coinhsl-archive-2015.06.23.tar.gz. Place this file in the current folder (ExaSGD_spack) 
7.	Install the coinhsl, using existing gcc9.2.0 and openblas from project ExaGO
```bash
spack install coinhsl@2015.06.23%gcc@9.2.0+blas ^openblas@0.3.10
```


Once HiOp and coinhsl are installed, one can find the corresponding module files if needed:
1.	Find the installation path of coinhsl
```bash
spack location -i coinhsl
```
 For example, it returns 
```bash
/autofs/nccs-svm1_home1/chiang7/spack_install/ExaSGD_Spack/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-power9le/gcc-9.2.0/coinhsl-2015.06.23-kizzx7n6vuwytfq7imrses6xidtpiruz
```
2.	Export this pathas below since another script will load coinhsl from this path later. NOTE the difference between the installation path and the module path!
```bash
export COINHSL_MODULE_DIR=/autofs/nccs-svm1_home1/chiang7/spack_install/ExaSGD_Spack/spack/share/spack/modules/linux-rhel7-power9le
```
#### The actual build (after all steps of Method 1 or Method 2 above were performed)
Finally one can build HiOp with all the dependencies (magma, metis, etc.) and coinhsl from the userâ€™s Spack path.
To build HiOp with default options, one should issue the command
```bash
MY_CLUSTER=summit ./BUILD.sh --build-only
```
To build a customized HiOp, one can issue from the root folder of HiOp the following:
```bash
export BUILDDIR=$PWD/build
source scripts/summitVariables.sh
cd build
#and, for example, build the sparse solver of HiOp
cmake -DHIOP_SPARSE=ON <other_hiop_build_options>  ..
```
