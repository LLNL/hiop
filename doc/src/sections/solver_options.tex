%% Solver options

\section{Solver options}
The user can control \Hi's options in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item via the options file(s) that should be placed in the same directory where the application driver using \Hi is executed. The format of an option file is very basic, each of its lines should contain a single pair \texttt{ option\_name option\_value}. Lines that begin with '\#' or consist of only white characters are discarded. The option value is checked to have the correct type (numeric, integer, or string) and to be in the expected range. If the checks fail, then the option is set to the default value and a warning message is displayed.
\item at runtime via the \Hi's API using the \texttt{options} member of the various NLP formulation and PriDec solver classes. The options object has three methods that allows the user to set options based on their types:
\begin{lstlisting}
 bool SetNumericValue(const char* name, const double& value);
 bool SetIntegerValue(const char* name, const int& value);
 bool SetStringValue (const char* name,  const char* value);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\warningcp{} Each option i. should be of one of types numeric/double, integer, and string; ii. has a value associated; iii. may have a range of values;  and, iv. has a default value. 

The NLP solvers load options from the file \texttt{hiop.options}. The PriDec solver will look for and load options from up to three files:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{hiop\_pridec.options} specifies options for the \textbf{PriDec} algorithm/solver
\item \texttt{hiop\_pridec\_master.options} specifies options for the NLP solver used to solve the \textbf{master} problem. This master NLP solver does not necessarily have to be one of \Hi's NLP solvers. The name of this file can be controlled via the string option \texttt{options\_file\_master\_prob} of the PriDec solver, in \texttt{hiop\_pridec.options}.
\item \texttt{hiop.options} specifies the options for the \textbf{worker} NLP solver. This applies only when the worker NLP solver is one of the \Hi's solvers. This file will not be used by worker solvers other than \Hi; they will use their default option files.
\end{itemize}

For example, when the PriDec solver is used with \Hi's NLP solvers for both the master and the worker subproblems, the user should create the three options files above to customize the PriDec, master, and worker solvers. As another example, when Ipopt is used for both master and worker subproblems, the user should use the default ``ipopt.opt`` file for the worker and use ``hiop\_pridec\_master.options'' for Ipopt options for the master subproblem (or, if another file needs to be used, change the name of the master options file via \texttt{options\_file\_master\_prob} in PriDec's \texttt{hiop\_pridec.options} option file).

If HiOp needs to solve a feasibility problem internally, it treats the feasibility problem as a new optimization problem and launchs a standalone internal process to solve the problem. The file, \texttt{hiop\_fr.options}, can be used to control the options for solving the feasibility problem by HiOp. The name of this option file can be tuned by parameter `options\_file\_fr\_prob'.

\warningcp{Note:} If an option file is not present, \Hi will use default values (unless the user changes the options at runtime via the API).

\warningcp{Note:} Options set in the options files overwrite options set at runtime via the above API.

\medskip

\noindent \textbf{bound\_relax\_perturb}: perturbation of the lower and upper bounds for all variables and all constraints relative to their magnitude. A variable or constraint (say the $i$th) with lower and upper bounds $(x_l)_i$ and $(x_u)_i$, respectively,  is ``relaxed'' accordingly to

\noindent \textbf{scaling\_max\_grad}: the user's NLP will be rescaled if the inf-norm of the gradient at the starting point is larger than the value of this option. Double values in $[10^{-20}, 10^{20}]$. Default value: $100$.
\medskip

\noindent \textbf{eq\_relax\_factor}: perturbation of the equalities to allow posing them as inequalities. This factor is relative to the maximum between the magnitude of the equalities rhs and 1.0. Used only by `hiopNlpSparseIneq' formulation class. Double values in $[10^{-15}, 1]$. Default value: $10^{-8}$.
\medskip




\subsubsection{Miscellaneous options}

\noindent \textbf{verbosity\_level}: integer between $0$ and $12$ specifying the verbosity of \Hi's output. A value of $0$ disables any output (but still outputs fatal errors). A value of $1$ also outputs warnings. The value of $2$ is reserved for future use. A value of $3$ will also output a table with \Hi's convergence metrics at each iteration. A value of $4$ and higher will display additional info related to the internals of the algorithm and is generally used only for debugging/development purposes. Those larger values are explained in hiopLogger.hpp. The higher the value the more verbose the output will be.
\medskip

\noindent \textbf{print\_options}: string option with ``yes'', ``no'' or ``short'' values deciding whether the options should be printed on the output before solver (re)starts. Setting this option to `yes' prints all the parameter names, values and descriptions, while `short' only prints the parameter names and values. Default value: ``no''.
\medskip

\noindent \textbf{write\_kkt}: string option with ``yes'' or ``no'' values deciding whether \Hi writes internal KKT linear system (matrix, rhs, sol) to external files. Default value: ``no''.
\medskip

\noindent \textbf{time\_kkt}: string option with ``on'' or ``off'' values deciding whether \Hi turns on/off performance timers and reporting of the computational constituents of the KKT solve process. Default value: ``off''.

\subsection{Options for PriDec solver}

Here we list the options that are recognized by the \Hi's PriDec solver.
 \subsubsection{Termination criteria and output}

 \noindent \textbf{tolerance}: maximum (absolute) error allowed. This value is compared against the decrease of the objective predicted by the solution to the subproblem with the approximation model ($q(x)$ in~\eqref{pridemobj}). Double values in $[10^{-14},0.1]$. Default value: $10^{-5}$.

  \medskip

  \noindent \textbf{max\_iter}: maximum number of iterations. Integer values between $1$ to $10^6$. Default value: $3000$.
  \medskip
  
  \noindent \textbf{acceptable\_tolerance}: PriDec solver will terminate if the inf-norm of the decrease in objective value is below this value for \texttt{acceptable\_iterations} many consecutive iterations. Double values in $[10^{-14},0.1]$. Default value: $10^{-3}$.

  \medskip

  \noindent \textbf{acceptable\_iterations}: number of iterations passing the acceptable tolerance (see \textbf{acceptable\_tolerance}) after which PriDec solver terminates. Integer values between $1$ and $10^6$. Default value: $25$.

  \medskip

 \noindent \textbf{verbosity\_level}: integer between $0$ and $12$ specifying the verbosity of \Hi's output. A value of $0$ disables any output (but still outputs fatal errors). A value of $1$ outputs warnings. The value of $2$ is reserved for future use. A value of $3$ will also output a table with PriDec solver's convergence metrics and trust-region type of measure of the quality of the approximation model at each iteration. A value of $4$ and higher will display additional info related to the internals of the algorithm and is generally used only for debugging/development purposes. The higher the value the more verbose the output will be.


\subsubsection{Algorithm selection and parameters}
  \noindent \textbf{alpha\_min}: lower bound for the scalar quadratic coefficient in the approximation model of the objective. It is a global value and has higher priority than the update rule of alpha. Double values in $[10^{-8},10^3]$. Default value: $10^{-5}$.

  \medskip

  \noindent \textbf{alpha\_max}: upper bound for the scalar quadratic coefficient in the approximation model of the objective. It is a global value and has higher priority than the update rule of alpha. Double values in $[1,10^{14}]$. Default value: $10^6$. An assert error will be reported if \textbf{alpha\_min} is bigger than \textbf{alpha\_max}.

\subsubsection{Miscellaneous options}

%% memory space selection aaaa

\noindent \textbf{mem\_space}: specifies the primary memory space in which PriDec solver's internal linear algebra objects will be created:
\begin{itemize}
\item ``default'' (default): allocations are done by \Hi in the cpu's memory space;
\item ``host'':  allocations via Umpire in Umpire's ``HOST'' memory space, typically CPU memory;
\item ``device'': allocations via Umpire in Umpire's ``DEVICE'' device memory space;
\item ``um'': allocations via Umpire's unified memory model, know as ``UM''.
\end{itemize}
\warningcp{} The memory space for PriDec solver must match the memory space used by the master NLP solver, otherwise undefined behaviour will occur. This consistency is not checked by HiOp since it is impossible to do so when black-box NLP solvers are used for the master problem. It is the user's responsibility to ensure that the memory spaces match. When HiOp is used a master solver, the PriDec solver's \texttt{mem\_space} option must match the master HiOp's option \texttt{mem\_space}. When a CPU master solver is used with PriDec solver, the PriDec's \texttt{mem\_space} option must be set to ``default''.


\medskip

\noindent \textbf{print\_options}: string option with ``yes'' or ``no'' values deciding whether the options should be printed on the output before solver (re)starts. Default value: ``no''.
